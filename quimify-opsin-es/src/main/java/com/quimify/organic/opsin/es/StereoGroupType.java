 * Indicate if a stereo-center belongs to a certain stereo group type. The group

 * stereo (currently only CXSMILES) you would normally also have a group number
 * (e.g. Rac1/&amp;1, Rac2/&amp;2, Rac3/&amp;3, etc) however there is currently
 * no way to specify this separation in IUPAC. An extension may be to indicate
 * grouping with parenthesis "(1RS)-,(3RS)-" "((1RS),(3RS))-". However the most
 * common cases of mixed stereo groups are likely to be where part of the
 * structure is known (absolute) and part is racemic/relative which can be
 * specified like this "(1RS,3R)-". The most common cases are all absolute, all
 * racemic (AND enantiomer), all relative (OR enantiomer).
